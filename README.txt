Simple Registration - A simple product registration code
by Marcus Povey <marcus@marcus-povey.co.uk>
================================================================================

Introduction:
-------------

This is a simple tool to generate and validate a product registration key using
a user's name and a shared secret (e.g. some product code).

This is NOT a particularly secure way of doing it, but it's not meant to be...
it's just to keep honest people honest :)

Made available here as there's no good reason not to, and it might be useful to 
people.
